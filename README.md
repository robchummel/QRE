# QRE
Quantum Reduction Engine POC
QRE
Introduction:
Quantum chemistry is a rapidly growing field that promises to revolutionize computational chemistry by utilizing the power of quantum computers. However, simulating complex quantum systems with even a relatively small number of qubits remains a significant challenge due to the exponential growth of the number of qubits required. The Quantum Reduction Engine (QRE) is a proposed solution to this problem, which aims to reduce the number of qubits required to simulate complex quantum systems. The QRE utilizes the Quantum Correlation Engine (QCE) and the Quantum Renormalization Group (QRG) to identify the degrees of freedom that are most relevant to the system and focus the computational resources on those degrees of freedom.


Research Problem:
The exponential growth of qubits required to simulate even relatively small quantum systems has been a significant challenge in quantum chemistry. This has limited the size of quantum systems that can be accurately simulated and has hindered the progress of the field.


Proposed Solution:
The QRE is a proposed solution to the challenge of simulating complex quantum systems with fewer qubits. The QRE utilizes the QCE and QRG to identify the degrees of freedom that are most relevant to the system and focus the computational resources on those degrees of freedom. The QRE has the potential to revolutionize quantum chemistry by enabling the simulation of larger and more complex quantum systems with fewer qubits, thus reducing the computational resources required for quantum simulations.


Research Plan:
The research plan for the QRE involves three stages: (1) Development of the QRE algorithm using Qiskit; (2) Validation of the QRE through simulation of simple chemical systems and comparison with classical methods using Qiskit's built-in features such as noise modeling and optimization algorithms; (3) Application of the QRE to simulate more complex chemical systems and comparison with classical methods using Qiskit.


In stage 2, the QRE algorithm will be validated through simulation of simple chemical systems, including hydrogen molecule (H2) and helium hydride ion (HeH+), which have been extensively studied in quantum chemistry. These systems were chosen because they represent simple, yet important examples of chemical systems with known ground state energy and electronic structure. The results from the QRE simulations will be compared with those obtained from classical methods, such as the Hartree-Fock and Density Functional Theory, to validate the effectiveness of the QRE in reducing the number of qubits required for accurate simulations.


In stage 3, the QRE will be applied to simulate more complex chemical systems, including water (H2O) and ammonia (NH3), which are important molecules in biochemistry and atmospheric chemistry, respectively. These systems were chosen because they represent more complex chemical systems with multiple degrees of freedom and have been the subject of extensive research in classical and quantum chemistry. The QRE simulations will be compared with those obtained from classical methods to demonstrate its effectiveness in reducing the number of qubits required for accurate simulations of complex chemical systems.
Significance:
The QRE has the potential to revolutionize quantum chemistry by enabling the simulation of larger and more complex quantum systems with fewer qubits, thus reducing the computational resources required for quantum simulations. This could lead to significant advances in the field and have a broad impact on other fields that utilize quantum computing. By utilizing Qiskit, the proposed research plan will benefit from the SDK's open-source nature, wide user base, and built-in features, making it a stronger and more promising proposal.
Conclusion:
The QRE is a promising solution to the challenge of simulating complex quantum systems with fewer qubits. The proposed research plan outlines the steps that will be taken to develop and validate the QRE, with the goal of revolutionizing quantum chemistry and advancing the field of quantum computing. We believe that the QRE has the potential to make a significant impact on the field and are excited to have the opportunity to work on this project.

Implementing the QRE algorithm in Qiskit involves several steps, including developing the QRE algorithm, coding the algorithm in Qiskit, testing and validating the algorithm, and applying it to simulate complex quantum systems. Here is an outline of a plan to implement the QRE in Qiskit:


Develop the QRE algorithm: The first step in implementing the QRE in Qiskit is to develop the QRE algorithm. This involves defining the QCE and QRG, and developing an algorithm to use these techniques to reduce the number of qubits required to simulate complex quantum systems.


Code the algorithm in Qiskit: Once the QRE algorithm is developed, the next step is to code the algorithm in Qiskit. This involves using Qiskit's tools and libraries to write the QRE algorithm code. It is essential to ensure that the code is efficient and optimized to minimize the computational resources required to simulate quantum systems accurately.


Test and validate the algorithm: After coding the QRE algorithm, the next step is to test and validate the algorithm. This involves using Qiskit's built-in features such as noise modeling and optimization algorithms to simulate simple chemical systems and compare the results with classical methods such as Hartree-Fock and Density Functional Theory. The results from the QRE simulations should be compared with those obtained from classical methods to validate the effectiveness of the QRE in reducing the number of qubits required for accurate simulations.


Apply the QRE to complex quantum systems: Once the QRE algorithm is tested and validated, the next step is to apply the algorithm to simulate complex quantum systems. This involves selecting suitable complex quantum systems such as water (H2O) and ammonia (NH3), which are important molecules in biochemistry and atmospheric chemistry, respectively. The QRE simulations will be compared with those obtained from classical methods to demonstrate its effectiveness in reducing the number of qubits required for accurate simulations of complex chemical systems.


Fine-tune and optimize the QRE algorithm: As the QRE algorithm is implemented and applied to more complex quantum systems, fine-tuning and optimization of the algorithm may be necessary to improve its efficiency and accuracy. This involves analyzing the performance of the algorithm, identifying areas that need improvement, and making the necessary adjustments to the algorithm.


Publish results and share code: After implementing the QRE in Qiskit, testing and validating the algorithm, and applying it to complex quantum systems, the next step is to publish the results in scientific journals and share the code with the quantum chemistry community. This will enable other researchers to build on the work and further advance the field of quantum chemistry.
The QRE algorithm is based on the Quantum Correlation Engine (QCE) and the Quantum Renormalization Group (QRG) techniques. The QCE is used to identify the degrees of freedom that are most relevant to the system and the QRG is used to focus the computational resources on those degrees of freedom.


The QCE identifies the degrees of freedom that are most correlated with the relevant observables of the system. This is achieved by calculating the correlation matrix between all possible pairs of observables, and then using spectral analysis to identify the dominant eigenvectors. These eigenvectors represent the degrees of freedom that are most correlated with the relevant observables and are the ones that need to be simulated with higher precision.


The QRG is used to eliminate the irrelevant degrees of freedom and focus the computational resources on the relevant ones. This is done by dividing the system into blocks and iteratively reducing the degrees of freedom of each block until a smaller representation of the system is obtained. The QRG can be used to iteratively coarse-grain the system, which reduces the number of qubits required to simulate the system while retaining the relevant information.


To implement the QRE algorithm in Qiskit, the following steps can be taken:


Define the QCE: The QCE can be defined in Qiskit using the built-in tools for calculating correlation matrices and spectral analysis. The correlation matrix can be calculated using the Pauli basis, which is a common basis used in quantum chemistry simulations. The spectral analysis can be performed using the built-in eigensolver in Qiskit.


Define the QRG: The QRG can be defined in Qiskit using the built-in tools for dividing the system into blocks and iteratively reducing the degrees of freedom of each block. The blocks can be defined based on the spatial or chemical symmetry of the system.


Implement the QRE algorithm: The QRE algorithm can be implemented in Qiskit by combining the QCE and QRG techniques. The QCE can be used to identify the degrees of freedom that are most relevant to the system, and the QRG can be used to focus the computational resources on those degrees of freedom.


Simulate the QRE algorithm: The QRE algorithm can be simulated in Qiskit using simple chemical systems, such as the hydrogen molecule (H2) and helium hydride ion (HeH+). The results from the QRE simulations can be compared with those obtained from classical methods, such as the Hartree-Fock and Density Functional Theory, to validate the effectiveness of the QRE in reducing the number of qubits required for accurate simulations.


Optimize the QRE algorithm: The QRE algorithm can be optimized using Qiskit's built-in features, such as noise modeling and optimization algorithms. The noise modeling can be used to simulate the effects of noise on the quantum system, which is an important consideration in practical applications. The optimization algorithms can be used to optimize the QRG procedure to obtain the most efficient coarse-graining of the system.


Apply the QRE algorithm to complex chemical systems: The QRE algorithm can be applied to simulate more complex chemical systems, such as water (H2O) and ammonia (NH3). The QRE simulations can be compared with those obtained from classical methods to demonstrate its effectiveness in reducing the number of qubits required for accurate simulations of complex chemical systems.


Overall, the development of the QRE algorithm in Qiskit involves defining the QCE and QRG techniques and implementing an algorithm that combines these techniques to reduce the number of qubits required for accurate simulations of complex quantum systems.

Qiskit:
Open-source: Qiskit is an open-source SDK, meaning that the QRE algorithm developed using Qiskit can be easily shared and replicated by other researchers. This openness promotes collaboration and helps accelerate progress in the field of quantum chemistry.

Wide user base: Qiskit has a large and active user community, which provides access to a wealth of knowledge and resources for developing and testing the QRE algorithm. The Qiskit community is also known for its active engagement with researchers and willingness to provide support.

Built-in features: Qiskit provides a rich set of built-in features that are particularly well-suited for the development of the QRE algorithm, such as noise modeling and optimization algorithms. Additionally, Qiskit has a user-friendly interface and provides powerful visualization tools, making it easier to interpret and analyze the results of simulations.

Introducing complex numbers for the number of lattice sites in each dimension could be an interesting approach to capturing more information with fewer dimensions. This approach is similar to the idea of introducing complex dimensions in certain mathematical models, such as in string theory.

In this approach, each lattice site would be described not just by its position in space, but also by a complex "orbital" that captures additional information about the particle's state. This could potentially allow for a more nuanced and accurate representation of the system.

However, it's important to note that introducing complex dimensions can also make the problem more difficult to analyze and solve. It would require developing new mathematical tools and techniques to handle the complex numbers and their interactions. Additionally, the computational cost of simulating such a system could be even higher than for a purely real-valued lattice.

Overall, this approach could be worth exploring, but would require careful consideration of the tradeoffs between added complexity and potential benefits in accuracy and information capture.
